# Code Challenges

## Overview
Not really using this area to compete, but rather to challenge myself each day to code in a number of different languages to become more fluent and, I believe, to become more creative in problem solving.  Each language takes a slightly different approach to problem solving by the nature of their language. 

## Challenges
These will start very simply, but will be completed in each of my targetted languages..C#, C++, Java, JavaScript and Python. Initially I feel pretty confident in C#, somewhat confident in Java, I know a little Javascript and C++ and Python scares the crap out of me. 

But not challenge will be considered complete without completions in each language. 

#HackerRank
I decided to begin with [HackerRank](./HackerRank/README.md) Both my Chingu and Bootcamp sessions end this month (July 2018) and I plan on keeping the momentum for the rest of year.
