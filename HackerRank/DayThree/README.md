# Conditionals
## Day Three
Given an integer, N , perform the following conditional actions:

* If N is odd, print Weird
* If N is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
* If N is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
* If N is even and greater than , print Not Weird

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.

# Objective

1. Declare  variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2. Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your variables.
3. Use the  operator to perform the following operations: 
4. Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.
5. Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
6. Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
